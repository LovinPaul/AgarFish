Description : 
- This project made me understand better the difference between UDP and TCP protocols. It is structured in three sub-projects, a singleplayer initial project and two multiplayer parts, one made with java.net.Socket and one with java.net.DatagramSocket .

Features:
- Simple/Multiplayer
- Chat Room for UDP multiplayer games.
